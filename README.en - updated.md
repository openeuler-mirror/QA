### Mission

The Quality Assurance (QA) SIG aims to test the software components that make up each openEuler release. Our goal is to improve openEuler community quality and the testing capabilities.

### Main Activities
- Build test capabilities and involve community developers in use and contribution.
- Draft, release, and maintain release criteria.
- Develop and maintain test tools to promote code development and execution efficiency.
- Make test plans and choose cases to execute the plans.
- Organize test open days, which focus on testing a specific feature or component.
